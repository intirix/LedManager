LedManager

LedManager is a system that allows me to manage my WS2801 and LPD8806 LED light strips from a Teensy 3.1 and a Raspberry Pi.  The Teensy 3.1 drives the light strip.  The Raspberry Pi controls the Teensy using the USB serial interface.  This allows me to set up schedules of when certain lighting displays turn on and off.  I can also change the display every so often to a random display.
